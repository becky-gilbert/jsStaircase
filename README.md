# jsStaircase

This is a JavaScript library for controlling one or more adaptive staircases. Much of this code is based on @hadrienj's StaircaseJS library. Please see the StaircaseJS readme file for more information on the background, usage, and examples: https://github.com/hadrienj/StaircaseJS/blob/master/readme.md

The jsStaircase library is a modified version by Becky Gilbert (@becky-gilbert) that provides additional options, such as a dynamic step size, as well as a number of other changes to the core implementation and methods.
